            <p>The Story of Silver Spark
                Life is not always crystal clear, but your jewelry can be. Founded in March 2005 by designer and gem-lover Eileen Ettinger, Silver Spark jewelry prides itself on finding the best pieces at the best prices. 
                With custom-made orders shipped in fewer than 3 business days, Silver Sparks guarantees they will match your outfits and personality to your jewelry. With three onsite master jewelers on the premises, necklaces, bracelets and earrings here are repaired and designed in just a few days.
                Even if you live on the other side of the world, just contact us with a description of your design and we will work with you until you are completely satisfied with your order. We will even mail you swatch and jewelry samples to help you find your fashion match. Appraisals are also done on and off site.
